## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I used some CSS that I had never applied before, like box sizing, box shadow and float, as well as I kept practicing paddings and margins, which I still have some trouble with.

### Continued development

I tried to use the JSON file in a simpler way, but I couldn't figure out how without using something like React or anthing else that would just overcomplicate this, if there's such an easy way to use a JSON file please let me know! I just ended copying and pasting it in the JS file.

ALSO! I couln't for the life of me just change the text of the <p> element inside the results divs without ruining the icon and results spans! I tried and tried and searched and searched and I just eventually gave up, if anyone knows how to do this PLEASE, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!

And of course, any feedback is appreciated!

### Useful resources

I struggled a bit with the box shadow, and while looking at its properties I found this pretty useful website!

- [CSS Box Shadow Examples](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - They have some prebuilt box shadows, I just picked the one that looked the most similar and copied the CSS code, I'm sure it can be useful in the future too!
